challenges and open to learning and reinventing himself as often as necessary.

    I had the opportunity to work in two different teams, but with the same focus, integration.

    - Integration System Team:
    Responsible for creating and maintaining APIs for integrating internal and external systems. The team's focus
    was to provide Rest APIs to integrate the legacy system in "Delphi" with the new services created by the
    innovation team in a scalable way and with high availability using messaging-oriented services. APIs were
    generally developed using SpringBoot, SpringBoot Integration and Python Tornado. In specific cases, other
    languages such as Golang were used to create microservices with specific needs such as I/O.
    
    - Internal Systems Team:
    Responsible for developing integrations with ERPs ORACLE EBS and IBM RTC and maintaining internal
    systems in Java and Pascal.
